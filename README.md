# Stick-Warrior
My first official indie game made using Unity. It's a platformer game involving stick figures.

The purpose of the game is to navigate through various areas to reach a goal while fighting many enemy stick figures. The goal can either be a finishing point or a boss. The player stick figure is armed with only a stick but as the game progresses, the player stick figure will get new weapons, one powerful than the other.
