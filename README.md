# Stick-Warrior
2D platformer game built in Unity featuring stick figures in combat.

## Overview
Stick Warrior is a side-scrolling platformer game developed in Unity. The purpose of the game is to navigate through various areas to reach a goal while fighting many enemy stick figures. The goal can either be a finishing point or a boss. The player stick figure is armed with only a dagger but as the game progresses, the player stick figure will get new weapons, one powerful than the other.

I created this project to strengthen my skills in game programming, real-time system deisgn, and gameplay scripting while gaining hands-on experience with Unity and C#.

## Tech Methods
* Unity
* C#
* GitHub

## Features
* Player movement system (jumping, dashing, directional input)
* Combat mechanics
* Collision handling and animation triggers

## What I Learned
Through this project, I gained experience in:
* Implementing gameplay mechanics using Unity and C#
* Designing modular character controllers
* Managing collision detection and combat logic
* Debugging gameplay systems and optimizing performance
* Structuring game projects using version control

This project strengthened my understanding of real-time systems and reinforced best practices for organizing code in larger projects.

## Future Improvements
* Add hit detection and damage logic
* Basic enemy AI with state-based behavior
* Health system for player and enemies
* Build simple AI behavior using state logic
* Add enemy types
* Implement guarding
* Add enemy AI decision-making
* Add sound effects and UI polish
* Add and expand levels
